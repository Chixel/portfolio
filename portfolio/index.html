                    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Matthew Neale. I'm a freelance game developer from France that likes working on projects that I find useful.
					   <br>
                       I mainly work within the Unity game engine but occasionally try out other things such as making websites, discord bots or even modding games.
					   <br>
					   I have 4 years of experience within the Unity game engine along with the C# programming language, and so I feel confident with most related tasks.
					   <br>
